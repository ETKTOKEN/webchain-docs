# WebChain Security Guidelines

**Version 1.1** | Last updated: September 24, 2025

## Overview

WebChain prioritizes security for both on-chain and off-chain operations. This document outlines best practices, recommended configurations, and safety measures for developers, validators, and end-users interacting with WebChain.

---

## 1. Authentication & Authorization

- All API requests that modify state must require proper authentication.  
- Use JWT or OAuth2 tokens for user sessions.  
- Validators must have role-based access to restricted endpoints.  
- Never expose private keys in client-side code.  

---

## 2. Data Encryption

- All communication with WebChain endpoints must use **HTTPS/TLS 1.2+**.  
- Sensitive data (private keys, OTPs, user information) should be encrypted at rest using AES-256 or equivalent.  
- Never log sensitive information.  

---

## 3. OTP & Transaction Security

- All off-chain to on-chain transfers and withdrawals require **One-Time Password (OTP)** confirmation.  
- OTPs must expire within a short window (e.g., 5 minutes).  
- Repeated failed OTP attempts should trigger temporary account lockout.  

---

## 4. Validator Layer Security

- WebChain token logic is handled **within the validator layer**; no external smart contracts are needed.  
- Validators should store private keys securely (hardware wallets recommended).  
- Rotate API credentials periodically.  
- Monitor validator activity logs for anomalies.  
- Restrict validator endpoints by IP whitelisting when possible.  

---

## 5. Logging & Monitoring

- Log only necessary operational events; avoid sensitive data.  
- Monitor unusual activity: high-value transfers, repeated failed OTPs, unexpected API calls.  
- Set up alerting for suspicious behavior.  

---

## 6. Incident Response

- Have a defined response plan for security breaches.  
- Immediately revoke compromised API keys.  
- Notify affected users and perform forensic analysis.  
- Update validator configurations if needed to mitigate risks.  

---

## 7. Additional Recommendations

- Keep WebChain nodes and dependencies updated.  
- Perform regular penetration testing on API endpoints.  
- Educate users on phishing attacks and account safety.  
- Use rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.
